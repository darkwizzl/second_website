      <h1>WHAT IS WEBSITE</h1>
      <p>
        A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages
        that share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained by
        an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of
        purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World
        Wide Web. Although it is sometimes called “web page,” this definition is
        wrong, since a website consists of several webpages. A website is also
        known as a “web presence” or simply “site”.</p>
      <h1 id ="funda">Learn Web Development Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals, including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
        Many aspiring Web Developers are now using coding bootcamps to fast-track the learning process. Coding bootcamps have thrived because they are short, immersive, and focused on outcomes and employment – their goal is to develop job-ready skills as efficiently as possible, making them an increasingly worthwhile investment for a would-be Web Developer. According to the job site Indeed, four out of five companies in the U.S. have hired a graduate from a coding bootcamp.
        In fact, the practical advantages of coding bootcamps are only getting clearer over time. For one thing, the field of web development naturally attracts people from all other fields, many of them making mid-career transitions – people for whom a clear and efficient path to skills expansion is a top priority. Further, employers increasingly value skills and experience over education, placing anyone who can prove their abilities on more equal footing with Developers holding a college degree.
        It’s important to note that Web Developers – more than most other fields – must be committed to ongoing learning to stay on top of changes in web development and programming languages, tools, and trends. This makes mid-career retraining a must whether or not it’s the line of work you started out in.</p>
    
      <H1 id="learn key">Learn Key Programming Languages for Web Development</H1>
        <p>Whatever your area of concentration, you’ll need to know how to use a handful of different programming languages for web development and web design. So, what are the most common programming languages?
          Three families of programming languages form the basic tools involved in virtually all aspects of web development: <br>
          &rtri; HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) <br>
          &rtri; CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) <br>
          &rtri; JavaScript <br>
          Of course, the list goes on – these are just the beginning. In fact, web development is such a diverse and varied field that the list of all the tasks it can include (and all the coding languages and markup languages you might use to accomplish them) is too long to fit in this space. Fortunately, as a specialist, you can find and concentrate on the ones that work best for you.</p>
