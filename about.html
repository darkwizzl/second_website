    <h1>What Makes a Good Web Developer?</h1>
    <p>
      According to BrainStation's Digital Skills Survey, 50 percent of
      executives say they will be doing the most hiring in development.
      Interestingly, though, our respondents also found development the most
      difficult field to hire for, and as the demand for these skills increases,
      it will only become more challenging. What should companies be looking
      for? And how can aspiring Developers stand out when entering the market?
      To start, consider the following definition, which provides a well-rounded
      picture of a good Developer: “Writes working code, that has been tested
      for correctness, in the time allocated, following accepted best practices,
      in a way that can be easily maintained and enhanced, in collaboration with
      their team, and continuously improves their knowledge and skills
      throughout their career.” Let’s take a closer look at these ideas to see
      what makes a good Developer. A good Web Developer must: Computers are
      extremely precise, digital machines. The slightest deviation from what a
      computer expects means that code won’t compile, won’t run or will crash.
      The whole point of programming and building software is to write code that
      the computer successfully processes, producing the desired result. In
      other words, a good Web Developer has to write code that works. He or she
      has a sharp eye for details and is constantly scanning code for anything
      that looks “off.” They write clean code that is well structured and uses
      tools to identify potential errors before the code runs. Write Code That
      Works Correctly Just because the code works, doesn’t mean it works
      correctly. Getting the code to work is only the first hurdle. Code that
      doesn’t work correctly is as useless as code that doesn’t work at all, and
      potentially more dangerous. Wrong results can have consequences, from
      mundane (and occasionally humorous) UI annoyances that frustrate end-users
      and inhibit their productivity — to the disastrous with loss of life or
      business revenue. All errors missed by Developers will cause program
      crashes, system failure, data corruption, security breaches, or turn away
      users who expect reliability. These errors become increasingly expensive
      to fix as they find their way into production and are discovered by
      end-users. Just as physical structures require thorough testing to ensure
      they are “up to code,” software requires the same stringent standards. A
      good Developer, therefore, adopts a test-driven mindset, actively
      imagining all scenarios where errors can occur, how they should be
      handled, and writing tests that prove the code is correct. Respect
      Timelines and Deadlines Computers represent the promise of efficiency and
      productivity. They allow users to accomplish and understand more.
      Developers work within this fast-paced world using computers to bring this
      productivity and efficiency to reality. A side-effect of this world is the
      expectation of having everything done now. That pressure comes from
      managers, clients, users, and the business climate of getting to market
      first. That can create a lot of pressure, and Developers are only human.
      Estimating time on projects is a difficult task, as there are many unknown
      and unexpected problems that come up when building complex software. There
      is always a temptation to underestimate and overlook the true details
      required to complete tasks. Yet underestimating time to delivery is
      dangerous, creating stress and burnout, the pressure to cut corners, and
      negative feelings from all stakeholders in the project. It is important to
      identify all details possible for a project, have a realistic perspective
      of the amount of work that can be accomplished, and reasonably
      overestimate timelines to account for the unknown and unexpected.
      Communication is key when timelines start slipping and making sure that
      everyone is aware of difficulties ahead of time helps to handle and avoid
      missing deadlines. A good Developer sets reasonable expectations,
      communicates openly about unexpected roadblocks, and maintains the trust
      of their team and other stakeholders. Follow Web Development Best
      Practices Once the code works (and works correctly), then it needs to be
      written in the best way possible. Whatever approach the Developer has
      taken in writing the code, it should be weighed against the solutions of
      the larger Developer community. A unique, novel approach may be an
      innovative solution–or it may lack considerations that other Developers
      have discovered over the years. Writing software is a complex process with
      a rich history of many minds thinking about the best way to solve common
      problems. The result is numerous best practices. Following these best
      practices saves time because problems don’t need to be re-solved (instead,
      existing solutions just need to be applied appropriately). This allows
      Developers to build “on the shoulders of giants.” Further, as different
      Developers contribute over time, there is a common understanding that any
      new Developer on a project can readily understand. There are two levels of
      best practices: industry-wide and company-wide. Company-wide practices
      will generally be a subset of industry-wide practices but adapted for the
      specifics of a company’s software domain, and the preferences of the
      Developers. A good Developer learns the best practices of their company
      and applies industry-wide best practices to save time and improve the
      overall quality of the code. Write Code That Is Easily Maintained and
      Enhanced The code compiles, runs, and has been tested for correctness.
      Things look good, but…how easy is it to change the code in the future?
      What happens if a new feature needs to be added? Engineer and Author
      Martin Fowler says: “Any fool can write code that a computer can
      understand. Good Programmers write code that humans can understand.” While
      a computer can run any valid code, ultimately the code is maintained by
      humans. At some point, a Developer is going to have to read, understand,
      and modify code that may have been written by another Developer (who may
      no longer be part of their team or company). Software development is a
      social endeavor, with many people working and relying on the codebase.
      Questions such as “How much is obvious from the code? How much needs to be
      explained? How quickly can the code be scanned and understood?” all help a
      Developer remember that they are not writing code for themselves. A good
      Developer writes high-quality code that other Web Developers can easily
      understand and modify. Collaborate With Their Team While a Web Developer
      spends much of their time interacting with a computer, the reality of
      their work environment is social. It’s important to respect the team, know
      the roles, and responsibilities, and what’s expected. Big picture
      questions ensure the Developer is properly aligned to the company and
      their role: “What is the vision/mission/values of the company? What is the
      product suite offered by the company? Who are the customers? Who do
      problems get reported to?” Knowing these details allows a Developer to
      grow within the context of their specific company or situation. A good
      Developer will, therefore, spend the time needed to understand the
      company’s best practices and standards. They will also improve the
      development process in ways that save time and increase productivity. Most
      importantly, they will have to have a positive attitude that makes the
      workplace more productive and supportive. A good Developer recognizes that
      their career and reputation is their responsibility. They strive to be a
      pleasure to work with, and always find ways to make the workload of their
      team lighter and more efficient
